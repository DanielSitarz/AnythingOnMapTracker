# Top 3 Feature Ideas for Map Tracker

Based on the current functionality and the primary use case of tracking visited places, here are the top 3 suggested features to enhance the map tracker:

1.  **Search & Filtering:**
    *   Implement a search bar to quickly find visited places by name or description.
    *   Add filtering options (e.g., by type, color, date range, custom fields) to control which markers are displayed on the map. This is crucial for managing a growing list of tracked locations.

2.  **Categorization/Layers:**
    *   Allow users to group visited places into categories (e.g., "Holidays 2024", "Weekend Trips", "Museums", "Restaurants").
    *   Implement map layers corresponding to these categories, allowing users to toggle the visibility of entire groups of places at once for better organization and focus.

3.  **Custom Data Fields:**
    *   Enable users to define and add their own data fields to each tracked place (e.g., "Rating", "Travel Companions", "Entry Fee", "Best Time to Visit").
    *   This provides flexibility to store specific details relevant to each user's tracking needs beyond the standard name/description/color. These custom fields could also potentially be used in the search/filtering feature.
